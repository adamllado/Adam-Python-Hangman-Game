Hangman Game created in Python using various functions to print the current game state of the hangman and the guessed word, as well as a function that handles duplicate letters of a guessed word.
Added a feature which calls an AI API to generate a hint for the used based on the randomWord. Learned how to setup a virtual enviornment using the terminal and add the necessary packages and import statements to successfully implement my API using "https://api.aimlapi.com/v1". Also included conditional logic within the API function to ensure that the AI response does not include the randomWord to be guessed by the user. 
There are 5 guesses total for each instance of a game, and a play again feature.
